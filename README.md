🏦 Banking Credit Scoring System
Global-Ready, Secure, and Automated Pipeline for Financial Risk Assessment

🌍 Why This Project Matters
In both the United States and Australia, financial inclusion and risk management are national priorities. This project addresses those needs by delivering a secure, modular, and automated credit scoring system tailored for banking environments. It demonstrates advanced engineering skills, domain expertise, and global readiness—key factors for migration pathways such as:
• 	🇺🇸 National Interest Waiver (NIW) – U.S. immigration for individuals with exceptional ability
• 	🇦🇺 Skilled Independent Visa (Subclass 189) – Australian migration for high-demand tech professionals

🔧 Features & Capabilities
• 	Modular Architecture: Clean separation of data ingestion, preprocessing, feature engineering, and model training
• 	Security-First Design: Integrated security scans using , code style enforcement with , and formatting via  and 
• 	Daily Automation: GitHub Actions workflow performs daily commits, testing, linting, and updates
• 	Test Coverage: All modules are covered with  to ensure reliability and maintainability
• 	Professional Documentation: Bilingual (English/Persian) documentation for global accessibility
• 	Real-World Application: Designed for banking institutions to assess creditworthiness, especially for underserved populations
