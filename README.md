 📊 Features

- Data ingestion and preprocessing
- Feature engineering for model optimization
- Training multiple ML models (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost)
- Model evaluation using precision metrics
- Saving and loading final models for deployment

 📦 Installation & Usage

```bash
# Create virtual environment
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run modules

📁 Data
The dataset includes customer demographics, credit history, income, debt levels, and payment behavior. Due to privacy concerns, raw data is not included in the repository.

📈 Preliminary Results
- XGBoost Accuracy: 92.4%
- AUC Score: 0.87
- Final model optimized using GridSearchCV
